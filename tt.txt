i like your shirt!
have you been here before?
this music is great.
what are you reading?
the traffic was awful today.
how was your weekend?
long time no see!
it's nice to meet you.
what do you do for work?
do you have any hobbies?
i totally agree.
you're right about that.
that makes sense.
i see your point.
i'm not so sure about that.
i don't think so.
i disagree.
that's not how i see it.
let's agree to disagree.
how are you doing today?
what's the weather like there?
i could really use a cup of coffee right now.
tell me something interesting.
i can't believe that just happened!
that's a great idea!
i'm feeling a little under the weather.
can you help me with something?
what's your favorite food? movie? book?
have you heard the news lately?
i see where you're coming from.
that's a fair point.
i can relate to that.
i hadn't thought about it that way.
there's definitely something to be said for that.
you might be onto something.
i can see both sides.
it's a tough call.
that's an interesting perspective.
absolutely!
exactly!
you got it!
couldn't have said it better myself.
you read my mind.
tell me about it!
i'm with you on that.
you're preaching to the choir.
i'm 100% on board.
no doubt about it.
i'm not so sure.
i don't know about that.
that's not my experience.
i beg to differ.
i think differently.
i have a different take on that.
i see it a little differently.
while i respect your opinion...
i understand what you're saying, but... no
i completely disagree.
i don't think that's right at all.
you're way off base.
that's simply not true.
i'm afraid i have to disagree.
i couldn't disagree more.
no way!
you're kidding, right?
let's just agree to disagree.
maybe we should move on.
i can respect that we have different views.
let's not argue about this.
we're not going to see eye to eye on this.
lovely day, isn't it?
can you believe this heat/cold?
hopefully, the rain holds off.
i hear it's supposed to snow later.
i can't wait for spring.
what a beautiful place!
the food here is delicious.
this music is really getting me in the mood.
i love your hat.
this line seems to be taking forever.
have you seen any good movies lately?
what kind of music are you into?
are you reading anything interesting?
do you have any pets?
have you been on vacation recently?
